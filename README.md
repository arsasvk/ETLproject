# ETLproject - Crime Data Analysis:

## Introduction

### Extract 

[Boston Data](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[Los Angeles Data](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

### Transform

* Offense Code group - was not found in both the csv files so could not use it . 

* Date Occurred column - was in different format so we had to format it to the same format.

* The fields had null values so we had to do dropna to cleanup the nan values.

* The location column had latitude and longitude in the same column so we had to split the values in separate columns
